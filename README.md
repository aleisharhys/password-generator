# password-generator

 I developed a sophisticated browser-based password generator. This application allows users to create secure passwords tailored to their preferences. Specify the desired length, choose from character types including lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters, and the generator ensures validation integrity. Upon a simple click, the generated password is presented either through an alert or directly on the page. It's a refined solution for personalized password creation. 🔐✨
